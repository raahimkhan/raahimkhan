## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science graduate and a dedicated software engineer with over 3 years of industry experience. Iâ€™ve worked with a range of technologies including, but not limited to, React Native, Expo, React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, Express.js, and MongoDB. I focus on building mobile applications end-to-end, covering everything from UI implementation to backend integration and release management. I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean, reliable, and user friendly applications.
